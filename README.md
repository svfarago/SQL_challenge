###  Known Bugs =====================
* pgAdmin was somewhat flaky when creating the schemas, importing data, and testing SQL queries. It required a browser reboot several times throughout this project and would run fine after the reboot.


### Troubleshooting ===============
* "--" comments are used liberally throughout the code to run individual lines of code for additional testing/troubleshooting, and general "--" comments are used for code notes/additional information.

* Resources used to build and troubleshoot this code are listed below, in addition to help and code peer review from students, instructor, and TA's.
